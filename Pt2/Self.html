<td> 
<li style="color:mistyrose;">To be selfless means to put others needs over your own. It's all about the intention and not necessarily the act that you commit.  We might give our time, our advice, our money, or our love. But even our giving can come from a selfish place which would not be considered being selfless as for example, sometimes people do things for attention and to be precieved as a nice person but if it doesn't come from your heart, it doesn't mean much.  </li> </td>
<td>
<li style="color:mistyrose;"> I live by this personal value by trying to be content and satisfied with everything that is given to me and try not to ask for more as that leads to selfishness. I try to always give and help out anyone in need. I try to help others before helping myself as I feel good helping others as it makes me happy.Overall, being selfless is really important to me as it makes a part of who I am since I have been taught to always think about others and I carry that with me everywhere.
