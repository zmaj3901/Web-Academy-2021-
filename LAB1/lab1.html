                    <p> I am 15 years old and I'm here to learn about how to build different programs like websites. I would like to get to know more about the internet as a whole. I want to expand the information I know about computers such as little short cuts in the computer and etc. I have worked with platforms in the past such as photoshop to edit the background of pictures. I also assisted in putting items on a website. In my free time, I like to cook and play sports such as soccer and gymnastics.</p>   
                    <p> Each tag represents for example, the p represents a paragraph as located next to the p is a paragraph about myself. The openeing and closing help to emphasize what's in the middle. Header in side the brackets emphasizes the header whioch you choose by making it bold and biog such as the school title.
