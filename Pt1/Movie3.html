<ul style="List-style-type:disc">
<li style="color:#E765B7;"> One of my favorite movies is Legally Blonde because it addresses a very important topic which is do not judge somebody's intelligence/smartness or their capabilities based on their choices in life or what they enjoy. It also tells people that in life, you can get up and do whatever you love if you develop determination and a passion for it. </li>

<ol type="I">
<li style="color:#FE3780;"> The movie is about a girl who is very much in to fashion but when her boyfriend breaks up with her as he states that he wants to marry someone who is smart and a lawyer, she gets the motivation to prove him wrong by applying and getting accepted to harvard. She is very persistent throughout and eventually solves a hard case using her fashion knowledge which proves everybody wrong. </li>

<ol type="I">
<ul style="List-style-type:circle">
<li style="color:#FB59EC;"> I choose this color scheme as the girl is a very bubbly girl and she loved pink as she work pink in the cover and I also believe that pink represents her personality in a way so I decided to choose different shades of pink throughout </li>
